# TerminalHacker

Maybe I've over done it a bit, but I wanted to fiddle around a bit more :-D.
I've created 3 different C# files (1 for easy mode and one for medium mode) where 2 are just partials of the main Hacker class, and one is a completely new class.
All are within the namespace of Assets - just for convenience.

Also I've used switch instead of if and already have impletemented the "Win" condition - because it wasn't that much code.
